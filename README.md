# convert-scripts
In this repository, you will find a collection of Python scripts sourced from various contributors, including Stability Ai, RunwayML, KohyaSS, and other Stable Diffusion-based scripters. These scripts are designed to facilitate both local and server-based conversions, providing users with a convenient way to convert safetensors or CKPT models to diffusers.

It's important to note that the code provided in this repository is not our original work. Instead, we have compiled these scripts to make it easier for users to leverage them for their own purposes. These scripts are intended to simplify the conversion process, allowing for seamless integration of safetensors and CKPT models into diffuser-based applications.

However, please be aware that these conversion scripts are not compatible with SDXL. For SDXL conversions, we recommend referring to the dedicated SDXL repositories available elsewhere.

We would like to emphasize that these scripts are primarily uploaded for educational use. While we provide these scripts for easier access and adoption, please note that we do not offer any support or maintenance for them.

Feel free to explore the repository and utilize these scripts to enhance your own conversion workflows. However, please keep in mind that they are provided as-is and without any warranty or support from us.
